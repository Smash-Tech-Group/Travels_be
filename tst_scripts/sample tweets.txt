@EPAScottPruitt is facing so many federal investigations and reviews that it's becoming difficult to keep track. Currently, multiple entities, including the @EPAoig, are investigating actions ranging from potential misuse of resources to other questionable decisions. Investigations 1 through 10 are under the @EPAoig's purview, looking into Pruitt's actions, while Investigation #11 specifically reviews whether Pruitt’s associate, Samantha Dravis, was collecting unnecessary expenses. It’s not just the EPA’s Office of Inspector General interested in Pruitt; the House Oversight Committee and additional government bodies, including the White House and Mick Mulvaney's office, are also involved. Investigations 13 and 14 add further layers to the scrutiny, and there are more investigations beyond these, with updates expected as new details emerge.\n\nIn another context, a judge is expected to add specific conditions to any probation, suspended sentence, or deferred sentence given to Papadopoulos, ensuring full compliance. If Papadopoulos fails to meet these court or federal requirements, he could face additional charges. It’s unlikely that Mueller would simply drop him as a witness due to the sentencing conditions, as there’s an almost certain chance Papadopoulos will remain under court supervision, with prosecutors ensuring his adherence to all conditions.

NY laws ALSO require specifics concerning ALL government grants--why are there still no amended disclosures from Clinton Foundation.\nThen look carefully @ AMENDED BYLAWS filed ALMOST FOUR YEARS LATE on 27 June 2017 in NY--Clinton family ILLEGALLY operated without proper oversight.\nOn CSTruth we have provided a link to the 18 November 2004 agreement with National Archives where they violated trust.\nThe IRS and The Justice Department must STEP UP THEIR GAMES--FRAUD is NOT the main question at Clinton Foundation--WHY DID this happen?\nFolks, sunlight is truly the greatest disinfectant of them all! I admit that I was one of the skeptics that was unsure of this.\nLike a Formula 1 race car. Every single image imaginable of what will be their life going forward was playing out in my mind.\nAfter reading the post below, I feel that my dream may actually become a reality! There were plenty of guilty moments I considered.\nI have had visions for over a year of waking up and turning my tv on and seeing arrests being made simultaneously across the country.\nCountry with our President. He absolutely lit up as he spoke about candidate and now President Donald J. Trump.\nThat gun on their nightstand began to get louder and louder. Some may have actually picked it up only to put it back down.\nLet’s see how that plays out going forward! At some point, the realization will hit them like a boulder.\n\nKenney's take on safe injection sites is horribly misguided, even in a vacuum, as DShepYEG points out.\nKenney is suggesting that he knows better than people who have dedicated their lives and careers to this field.\nWhether it be healthcare, education, infrastructure, the environment, or harm reduction strategies for the opioid crisis, evidence-based policy is key.\nI'm of the belief that the most successful politicians are the ones who will listen to the experts in whatever the field may be.\nWe see the same thing in the dealings with environmental policy and the economics behind it.\nI don't know when or why we decided that shunning evidence-based policy was the best way forward, but it's not a good path.

Just FYI, this was the tweet a lot of people on 8ch believe #Qanon was referencing. You can see the "I kept my word" in the context. REALITY CHECK: Pruitt has spent $3 MILLION on security and travel in just over a year. His security detail is three times the size of previous administrators. REALITY CHECK: Here's where you could stay in DC for the rent Pruitt was paying his fossil fuel lobbyist landlord. REALITY CHECK: While Pruitt is a dangerous threat to the health of our families, his sloppy and careless legal work has put many at risk. REALITY CHECK: Trump is defending a guy who regularly defies him. #BootPruitt ....over and over again. #BootPruitt REALITY CHECK: Trump is also defending the guy who called him an "empty vessel." #BootPruitt REALITY CHECK: To top it all off, Pruitt's spending and behavior is because, according to many, he wants to be Trump’s chosen successor. Pruitt is a danger to the public, yet is losing in the courts while conning @realDonaldTrump into saving his job. My @Sony "smart" TV has updated itself and tried to force me to use a new app. From their own privacy policy, they track what you watch, when you watch it, your location, and other personal details. This information is then used to market to you within the TV and offer you a "hot list" of recommendations. If you have a "Smart TV" from any brand and it's doing an update, you will 100% want to disable Samba.

Part 5: #Qanon updates on apparent #Snowden operation. Posts pictures of a building in what looks like many neighborhoods. Hmmm...Q is on the hunt for @Snowden. This looks like it could be Hong Kong. I lived there from 1976-1980. A lot has changed. 2. Q appears to want us to push this hash tag: #internetbillofrights. 3. Q tells us the #internetbillofrights has nothing to do with AT&T. This scares the Clowns more than anything because it challenges their control. 4. Just a theory here but IF Snowden has flipped because he is now, according to Q, a "liability" to Clowns (like a chess piece), this could mean big things. 5. It seems pretty clear CLOWNS control social media. Eric Schmidt (former Google CEO) likely wrote the code to censor. 6. An anon responding to Q's question "Who performs in a circus?" (I thought the answer was CLOWNS), mentioned Snowden. 7. Q responds to an anon who had concerns about IBOR. Q clarifies 1st Amendment can't be enforced upon private companies. 8. This anon did a great breakdown of a potential timeline for Q's use of "BOOM" in multiple drops. Sounds plausible. @threadreaderapp please unroll. Startup funding shouldn't just go to white Ivy League Bay Area bros, so I'm sharing the top fundraising tips from A. The best startup pitches identify a big problem, show why your product is the solution, and then prove your potential. Practicing your startup pitch is critical because it A/B tests narratives, unearths hard questions, and breeds confidence. The unintuitive secret to startup fundraising isn't the pitch where everyone has their own style, but the process of creating connections. Startups should assume they'll get a ton of NOs from investors before a Yes. Identify partners with expertise & track record. If you don't hear back from an investor in 1-2 days, they don't like you. If they don't ask questions, they don't love your idea. Don't write off lesser-known investors. A mid-tier fund's YES beats a top dog's No any day. Once you get a term sheet, negotiate like your life depends on it. Startups can die waiting for an investor's due diligence to finish before they get the cash. The median wait after pitching is usually around 3 months. Startup burn rates balloon to the size of your bank account if you're not careful. Be thrifty. Cash should last 12-18 months. The best startup tip is still "don't quit". When investors say no, employees leave, competitors emerge, and you will want to throw in the towel.

@threadreaderapp unroll please. 1) We Patriots must expand our thinking. If you haven't watched Red October, you should. It depicts exactly what's happening in our world today. 2) In the Movie, the USSR designed a Submarine that could run so silent that it couldn't be detected. The Sub was designed to evade all sorts of tracking technology. 3) #DeepState is designed to put the proper people in place to be able to subvert laws in its erosion of the Constitution. 4) @POTUS and the @USMC are using Military Intelligence to locate these #DeepState 'sleepers' that are in our Government. 5) The reason you don't see any arrests or media coverage is because it is indeed a 'Civil War' going on behind the scenes. 6) Back to Red October - One of the final threats to Ramius handing the Russian Sub over to the Americans is that they would be seen as traitors by their own people. 7) That is exactly what Trump & the Marines are facing. They have to take out the #DeepState actors that have infiltrated our government and institutions. 8) What can we do? PRAY! Pray for POTUS. Pray for America. Pray for our Military & our Marines. Pray that they can succeed in this fight. 9) What else can we do? Vote! Vote like your Life and Nation depends on it. Because it does. Trump needs help. He needs our support. #MkUltra should terrify everyone.

It’s hard to keep up with all the threats facing young children these days, but recent changes to the EPA are raising significant concerns. Our children deserve environmental policies that will protect their health. But @EPAScottPruitt is protecting large corporations instead. Here are 5 recent environmental safety changes that are threatening children’s health: 1. Pruitt has reversed a ban on chlorpyrifos, a common pesticide and known neurotoxin that has been shown to harm children’s brains. 2. The EPA weakened standards for toxic metals—like lead and mercury—in our air and water. Children are especially vulnerable to the dangers of these metals. 3. The EPA is allowing corporations to release more pollutants into the air. Poor air quality can cause asthma and other serious health issues for children. 4. The EPA is now letting chemicals go to the market, even if there are concerns about the risks of exposure to those chemicals. 5. The EPA announced that it would close an important office that studies the effects of chemical exposure on children’s health. Rather than prioritize big corporations, our representatives must do what is best for the health and safety of our children. Are you worried about what these changes could mean for you or your family? Share your story here:

Member states have no right of initiative in international organisations meaning that good ideas die in Brussels. It says it wants free and fair trade but the complexity of its own bureaucracy means it can always find ways with. Virtue signalling as public policy. The EU wants to be seen as a benevolent influence so it subscribes to green. Its energy directives are directed by groupthink, corporate lobbying and political fads leading to environmental. The Common Agriculture Policy. An obsolete idea where, like the CFP, reform is glacial and creates massive market distortions. The Common Fisheries Policy. Even minor changes to protect species take several years, again blocked by corporate interests. The Agency Workers Directive: Yet another whack-a-mole measure to resolve issues caused by the last round of measures. The very idea of being in a treaty structure where all of our external relations and trade is bound up in one single framework. The Habitats Directive. Seldom are quota and target driven policies ever a good idea. It results in policy decisions that lack real impact. The way in which it encourages member states to dismantle their own foreign relations in the greater glory of the EU. The measure of the common good is nearly always what the financial spreadsheets say, irrespective of what people actually need. The way in which there is no longer any clear line of accountability. We no longer know who is responsible for decisions. The way in which invisible legislative restraints curb local democracy and stifle policy innovations, often for no good reason. The fact that even if we could say we had adequate powers of veto, we simply cannot trust our own vain and venal politicians. The way it undermines genuine multilateral cooperation by setting up rival bodies with a view to co-opting the agenda. The propensity to invest in political white elephants like A380 and Galileo just because it feels it should have. The fact that political union is not necessary for trade and economic integration. It uses economic integration as a cover. The very existence of the EU and its supranational agenda actually stands in the way of something better. I just don't like the EU. I don't support its aims, I do not trust its institutions, I don't want a supreme government.

#FundraisingFraud is not uncommon, according to the Better Business Bureau. Online communities like #TheResistance need to be cautious. If a fundraiser isn’t a non-profit, ask questions about what the money is for and how it will be spent. Crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe, YouCaring, and Kickstarter do minimal screening for their fundraising campaigns, so it's crucial to vet these efforts. The most important questions to ask are about the money—what is it for? A legitimate business will readily answer these inquiries. If merchandise claims a portion of proceeds will go to charity, confirm the details. There are even people seeking donations to “start up” non-profits; evaluate their services carefully. It takes little effort to find out the costs of filing for non-profit status. Anyone requesting money for a cause that isn’t a verified non-profit should be scrutinized. To act in good faith, one should file for non-profit status first, as non-profits are legally accountable for their fundraising. On GoFundMe, if the recipient isn’t Facebook Verified, don’t donate. I wrote this because I’ve seen many questionable accounts profiting from #TheResistance, and I believe transparency is essential.

Yale history prof @TimothyDSnyder outlined 20 lessons from the 20th Century on preventing tyranny. First, do not obey in advance or offer to comply with the new regime. Defend independent institutions that oppose authoritarianism. Beware of the emergence of a one-party state; everyone’s right to dissent must be defended. Remove symbols of bigotry and hate, taking responsibility for societal representation. Remember professional ethics; businesses should not exploit vulnerable populations. Beware of paramilitary groups that threaten democracy. Public servants with weapons should reflect on their roles. Stand out and act; don’t passively follow as freedoms are eroded. Be mindful of language and engage in thoughtful discourse. Investigate claims and support good journalism. Foster personal connections within your community. Participate in activism with diverse groups. Protect your privacy and maintain a secure personal life. Contribute to reputable charities regularly. Learn from international peers and foster friendships abroad. Listen for dangerous rhetoric from authorities. Stay calm in crises; tyrants exploit emergencies. Finally, be a patriot by exemplifying the values of democracy for future generations.

One of the reasons for #BlackHistoryMonth is that blacks are so often systematically erased from history, or simply born in Kentucky in 1877, he was the son of former slaves, reared in the reconstruction South. Actually, he also had to flee north to Cincinnati as the KKK would move into the area, where blacks were far more accepted. At the age of 14, Morgan fled north to Cincinnati, away from the active KKK in Kentucky. With only a 6th grade education, he caught the attention of the entire textile industry in Cleveland, leading to a significant raise when hired by another firm. He became so skilled at repairing the sewing machines that they gave him a job as a repairman. Not content with that, Morgan expanded his business to fashion and tailoring, then to hair products, patenting a successful product. The business was a runaway success, and he saw the chaotic and crowded streets of Ohio leading to many traffic accidents, which inspired him to invent a three-point traffic signal. Being a black man, he was unable to sell his invention, so he hired a white friend to pretend to be the inventor. There was almost nothing that this man could not invent. He also began printing and publishing his own newspaper. In 1916, during the development of Lake Erie, a tunnel explosion occurred 50ft below the water, and dozens of workers were trapped. Yet, when the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission handed out awards for bravery during the disaster, few of the white rescuers were willing to trust their lives to a black man's invention. Later in life, Morgan supported the NAACP, dedicating much of his wealth and time to support civil rights. In the end, when the local Country Clubs refused him entry, he simply founded his own, all-black club. So, next time you stop safely at a traffic light, remember Garrett Morgan. He had a saying: 'My name is Morgan, but it ain't J.P.'

20. By my understanding of the word democracy - the people having the power to shape the rules they live by, I cann’t. That you think those things did influence my vote is ultimately the snobbery that swung the referendum. Vote Leave. 2. It was easily countered by way of saying that those jobs depended on trade with the EU, not membership of a p. 1. Time for a #Brexit history lesson. Us old school leavers bumped into the remain canard that 'three million jobs.' If asked if we would support a Brexit that would necessarily result in new barriers to trade, pretty much everyone. To that effect, every Vote Leave politician or spokesman at some point in the campaign cited Norway as a means of. It is actually a relatively recent thing that only the hardest Brexit qualified as 'The One True Brexit.' Though they always struggled to produce credible intellectual material, they have proven adept at manipulating the. With the aid of their useful idiots at Spiked Online and their respective knitting circles, they have successfully. Having sympathizers at Conservative Home, they have gradually fed in their poison, littered with jargon so as to. Over the last few months, we have witnessed a London leaver bubble evolving which relies on the ignorance and bov. For sure, there are still remainers in the public domain who will do anything to sabotage Brexit, and we have sympathizers. This is of course, utter bollocks. There is a growing contingent of largely voiceless leavers who see merit in. The Leave Alliance took the view that in order to safeguard jobs and trade, we would need a model that preserves. Of course, we adults know that all trade agreements and every international accord is on some level the expenditure. The useful idiots of @spikedonline etc. will back them because they have given the matter no strategic thought and. In fact, the Tory Taliban would have got nowhere without the manifest ignorance of leading leavers - many of who. This is the Minford model - the one that basically assumes that if we unilaterally liberalize on all trade barriers. But by way of having a stranglehold over the narrative - largely thanks to a London-centric media, the Brexit ay. As far as we are concerned, the decision to leave is not all that controversial. The goals of the EU never enjoy.

This is only revealing the disdain and hate the left has for our military. They see our troops as mere tools. No military commander will ever give such an order. I even read tweets from deranged leftists arguing that the US military would act against civilians. Here is the truth: in the event of a civil war started by the government attempting to ban and confiscate civilian arms, our military has been voting overwhelmingly Republican election after election. Worth mentioning that a sizable number of law enforcement officers as well as regular gun owners are also on our side. Activists who already took an oath to defend the US, its people, and the US Constitution, including the Bill of Rights and the 2nd Amendment, will stand with us. As many of you may know, before emigrating to the US, I lived half my life under a communist regime. I was an armed reservist called back to duty during the days of the 1989 anti-communist revolution that ended the tyrannical Ceausescu regime. The Ceausescu regime ordered the repression of civilians protesting for freedom in the streets, but the military stayed put in the barracks and refused to participate in the repression. On December 20th, the day before Ceausescu fled from the government headquarters, there were rumors he was "suicided" by his Securitate thugs, and we will probably never know the truth since there were military orders to shoot on the Romanian people protesting for their rights. Ceausescu had goons for insurance in case he would be betrayed, and they went on shooting at people randomly. The next day, on the 21st, Ceausescu realized he couldn't count on the military. What I am trying to demonstrate with this story is that if two commanding Generals of a communist army refused orders to fire on civilians, what are the chances you anti-gun leftists think there are for an American General to do so? The 1989 Revolution cost was paid in blood by 2,500 dead Romanians, and probably three times as many were injured. The military first remained in the barracks, then later not only joined the people but also opened its armories. They had cannons, missiles, a navy, helicopters, and war planes. But that didn't help him much against a popular uprising.

The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER. We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy. They can go find another “sucker!” There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the U.S. Dollar in International Trade, and any Country that tries should wave goodbye to America.
